'''
You have been asked to help study the population of birds migrating across the continent. Each type of bird
you are interested in will be identified by an integer value. Each time a particular kind of bird is spotted,
its id number will be added to your array of sightings. You would like to be able to find out which type of 
bird is most common given a list of sightings. Your task is to point the type number of that bird and if two 
or more types of birds are equally common, choose the type with the smallest ID number.

For example, assume your bird sightings are of types arr=[1,1,2,2,3]. There are two each of types 1 and 2, and
one sightings of type 3. Pick the lower of the two types seen twice: type 1.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer denoting m, the number of birds sighted are reported in the array arr.
The second line describes arr as n space-separated integer representing the type number of each bird sighted.
Constraints: 5 <= n <= 2*10^5
It is guaranteed that each type is 1, 2, 3, or 5.
Output Format
Print the type of the most common bird; if two or more types of birds are equally common, choose the type with 
smallest ID number.

Sample Input 
6
1 4 4 4 5 3
Sample Output 0
4
Explanation 0
The different types of birds occur in the following frequencies:
Type 1: 1 bird
Type 2: 0 birds
Type 3: 1 bird
Type 4: 3 birds
Type 5: 1 bird
The type number that occurs at the highest ferquency if type 4, so we print 4 as our answer.

TEST CASE 1:
6 1 4 4 4 5 3

OUTPUT:
4
