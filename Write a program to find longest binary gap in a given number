'''
A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends
in the binary representation N

For example,
Number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2
The number 529 has binary representaion 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and 
one of length 3. so 4 is the longest binary gap.
The number 20 has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1.
The number 15 has binary representation 1111 and has no binary gaps.
The number 32 has binary representation 100000 and has no binary gaps.

For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation 10000010001 and 
so its longest binary gap is of length 5. 
Given N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps.

TEST CASE 1:
529

OUTPUT:
The longest binary gap is 4

TEST CASE 2:
15

OUTPUT:
No binary gap
